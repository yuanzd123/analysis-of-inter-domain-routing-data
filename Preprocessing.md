## Pre-processing of Data ##

a.	First I analyzed the BGP sample data. But it was too  short to get a complete picture of what’s happening behind the scenes so for proper understanding of the data I converted file from the given link into ascii file.(For more details look into ProblemApproach.)

b.	Since these files are very large, I used external tool for viewing the large file : large text file viewer.

c.	I analyzed the data for the converted ascii file and used it for answering out questions.

First I analysed the BGP data of first chopped file of 4920000 lines for the first 4 questions. This provides an overall view of collective data analysis performed over the BGP data.

d.	For predicting trends from different times and generations I simultaneously converted the BGP data from previous month of BGP data analysis.

e.	After pre-processing, I started working on writing Perl scripts for chopped data’s files using Linux system.
