perl commands used:

1. perl -v : to know if perl is installed propelry and the version of perl
2. perldoc perl : docs of perl
3. perldoc -tf print : dc of the print command
4. run a perl script by perl <abc.pl>
5. in UNIX running the perl prg as a prg not a script  do : chmod 755 <abc> now u can run it as ./abc or abc. Don't ever name your program "test" under Unix.
The Unix shells have a command called test, and you'll be very frustrated when the
wrong program runs

6. scalar constants called literals: numeric literals and string literals.
7.Variables such as $_, $", $/, $2, and $$ are special variables and should not be used as normal variables in your Perl programs.
8.If your program has -w on the #! line at the beginning,
the directive "use warnings" appears in your program (Perl 5.6).If you invoke Perl with the -w
switch on the command line,try to use the value of a variable that you haven't
previously set, Perl responds with this error message when your program runs and you try to use the value: Use of uninitialized value. i.e : using : #!/usr/bin/perl -w
